\cvinterest
{Software programming language, software architecture design and implementation}
{
	\begin{cvitems}
		\item{As a PhD student and a practitioner in software engineering, I am passionate in programming, especially the use of mainstream programming languages such as C/C++, Java, and Python for development of software applications (e.g. reactive embedded system applications) for solving everyday life problems. I'm also interested in knowing practices how to be productive and qualitative in programming.}
		\item{A major part of my thesis work is about extending, engineering, and transforming software programming language. Especially, I'm interested in extending current programming languages to assist developers to be productive and qualitative in software development.}
		\item{During PhD time, I have learned about application of event-driven architecture to asynchronous systems such as distributed systems. I'm interested in using programming model and network protocols to develop distributed and/or embedded applications, which will involve network technologies such as communication protocols or routing algorithms as well as the combination of peer-to-peer and client-server model as in my undergraduate at HUST.}

\cvinterest
{Research and Development of Embedded and Distributed Systems}
{\begin{cvitems}
		\item{In my thesis, I work in the context of development of embedded software systems, in which I use UML and design patterns for designing such systems (or software in general). I'm therefore interested in diving into this domain as deep as possible. Furthermore, I want to combine my knowledge about the network technologies that I have collected to produce distributed embedded software systems. The latter, in my thought, are very suitable to the development (design and coding) of IoT applications, in which devices collect, process, and exchange data with each other, and which might be combined with machine learning field. Using UML, from my point of view, would be very helpful for the complexity management task of such systems.} 
		\item{My vision is that, to make IoT realizably efficient, investigation should be made to combine distributed systems and cloud computing to form distributed cloud computing, that is much similar to fog and edge computing. In the latter, services (such as data analytics) are moved towards closer to the end-users and IoT devices (instead of being located at the cloud center) to reduce latency and increase user experiences and data privacy.}
\end{cvitems}}

\cvinterest
{Machine learning}
{\begin{cvitems}
		\item{The field of machine learning and its application have been attracting many practitioners including myself.
During my master education, I was taught about machine learning (modules data fusion and statistic learning and neural network). 
Since there, I have been keeping my passion and learning practically, especially using Python, the use of different learning models for understanding data and prediction. I'm currently actively getting knowledge about machine learning and deep learning, using Python libraries such as Numpy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas and TensorFlows to solve practical problems such as face recognition, natural language processing...}
\end{cvitems}
}

\cvinterest
{Model-Based Software Engineering}
{
	\begin{cvitems}
	\item{The main research interest of my PhD thesis are methodologies for synchronization of code and model specified in UML-based component-based modeling and UML state machines, and studying different techniques for model transformation such as QVT, ATL, Triple-Graph Grammar (TGG), and Change-driven transformation, for model synchronization such as QVT-Relation and TGG.	
I'm also involved in researching approaches for a mapping of a UML model containing the ALF code, and programming language code.
This mapping will enable a synchronization of UML model with ALF and programming code, and eventually provide synchronization of a platform-independent model with code.
Furthermore, I'm also interested in approaches for simulating a system from its models and generating fully operational code from models, especially UML models, which might contain ALF code, approaches for optimizing software system at the model level (e.g. optimization ALF code or UML state machines), and if possibly approaches for model interpretation and compilation.
The final goal is harmonization of software programming and MDE practices.}

\cvinterest
{Model-Driven Engineering with Large Models}
{
	\begin{cvitems}
		\item {I have been working with Papyrus UML models during my thesis for generating real case-study embedded systems, e.g. 12000 lines of code generated for the Lego Car factory case study. When models become large, the processing of the models, e.g. querying and loading for model transformations, becomes very slow, which might harms the adoption of modeling techniques to industrial development. For this, I'm very interested in studying techniques for speeding model manipulations up such as incremental model query with IncQuery or the PrefetchML prefetching and caching language for caching models.}
