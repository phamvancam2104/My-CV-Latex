\cvskill
{Time-project management} % Category
{This skill is important to complete my PhD during 3 years and to manage my own research and development project (that I will finish it in January 2018). Furthermore, I also met the many deadlines for submitting conference papers and in my teaching.
	I have learned to manage these different tasks.} % Skills
