\cvskill
{Time-project management} % Category
{This skill is important to complete my PhD during 3 years and to manage my own research and development project (that I will finish it in January 2018). Furthermore, I also met the many deadlines for submitting conference papers and in my teaching.
	I have learned to manage these different tasks.} % Skills

\cvskill
{Problem solving} % Category
{As a PhD student, I have learned two very important skills, which are problem identification, by rigourously analyzing the state of the art and the practice, and problem solving, by deliberately thinking and discussing various solutions to a particular problem and finding the best one, while taking in consideration other constraints such as deadlines and teaching duties.} % Skills
