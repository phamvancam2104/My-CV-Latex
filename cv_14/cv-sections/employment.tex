		\item {I have been working as a software engineering and PhD Student, under supervision of Dr. Ansgar RADERMACHER, Dr. S\'ebastien G\'ERARD, and Dr. Shuai LI, at LISE, which develops the Papyrus industrial modeling tool, especially the use of UML to design complex system software. My work involves: the use of UML for designing component-based architecture and event-driven behaviors for reactive and distributed systems in the context of the Papyrus Designer tool; the corresponding implementation of the UML-based design; the process of automatically translating the UML-based software design model into efficient executable code; and the process of automatically propagating modifications of the code back to the model. Technically, I have been working with several mainstream programming languages such as Java, C++, and C and have a deep understanding of the programming languages in order to generate code from models. I also extend the standard C++ programming language to support component-based developemnt for better managing complexity in code-centric development approaches, especially for reactive systems. An Arm-based Lego Car factory application is developed for demonstration.}

{CEA, Saclay, France} % Location
{Apr. 2014 - Sept. 2014} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) bullet points
	\begin{cvitems}
		\item {I worked as an intern undersupervison of Dr. Ansgar RADERMACHER in the context of applying component-based modeling and design to distributed system development. I used UML and a UML profile for designing interactions between distributed components in distributed systems. The created design is then automatically translated into code, which uses the ZeroMQ middleware to exchange data between distributed components.}

{Jul. 2012 - Aug. 2013} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) bullet points
	\begin{cvitems}
		\item {I worked as a software developer in three projects: (1) deal with requirement analysis, detailed design, implementation, unit test, integration test, and optimization at the programming level for software of an embedded system: Toshiba G2R protection relay. The development using C as the development language and Visual Studio as an integrated development environment (IDE) includes using IEC 60870-5-103 to control and communicate between smart electric device, and testing on real hardware and using debug tools to debug on hardware; (2) develop a desktop application to control electric devices by using a private protocol of Toshiba and the C\# language. The application polls the devices to receive data of recorded errors, and creates a chart for analysis of errors causes; and (3) use the Qt IDE and the C++ ffmpeg library for implementing a multimedia player application, which plays both audio and video files.}
